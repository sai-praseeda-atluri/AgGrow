## Overview

AgGrow is built using Flutter, an open-source UI software development toolkit by Google. The application is structured to provide easy navigation and access to various sections, such as the main page, crop details, land information, and settings. Each section is designed to offer valuable insights and information relevant to agriculture.

## Features

### Adaptive Theme

AgGrow supports both light and dark themes using the `adaptive_theme` package. Users can switch between themes based on their preferences, enhancing the user experience in different lighting conditions.

### Bottom Navigation Bar

The app features a bottom navigation bar implemented using the Google Nav Bar package. This navigation bar allows users to seamlessly switch between the Home, Crops, Land Info, and Settings sections.

### Seasonal Crop Selection

AgGrow provides dropdown menus for selecting a season and viewing crops that are best suited for that season. This feature helps users plan their planting and harvesting activities according to seasonal conditions.

### Detailed Crop Information

The app includes detailed pages for various crops. Users can select a crop from the list and navigate to its specific page to view information such as growing conditions, best practices, and other relevant details. The crop pages cover a wide range of crops including Wheat, Barley, Cotton, Cucumber, Maize, Muskmelon, Mustard, Rice, and Watermelon.

### Land Information
